#  Social media dashboard with theme switcher

A web app that shows the social media growth of a determined user across platforms. It includes a theme switcher that toggles from dark to light mode and it's made with a fully responsive design in mind. When a card or an Overview card is clicked, a modal showing a graph of the growth appears. 


- Sass chosen for styling due to simplicity and to practice using the tool 

- All color variables are stored in the variables.scss file for the sake of readability

- Made separate components for the main social cards and the overview today cards. Also made separate component for the Theme switcher toggle

- Separated the styles of each component into different files to make it easier to read, find, and change if needed

- Made the modal with HTML tag dialog for easier use, Web Accessibility and to comply with proper HTML semantics

- Made the theme switcher with an input for easier use, Web Accessibility and to comply with proper HTML semantics

- Passed specific info for the cards through props thinking of scalability of the project, even if in this demonstration values are hardcoded

- Left some comments to explain the purpose of functions to aid myself and future Devs 

- Uploaded to a public github repository in my account AriadnaMaldonadoGrieco https://github.com/AriadnaMaldonadoGrieco

- Checked project worked in Safari, Chrome, Edge and Firefox browsers
